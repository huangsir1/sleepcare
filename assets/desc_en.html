<font color="#909090">
<P>It can be tough to identify sleep apnea on your own, since the most prominent symptoms only occur when you’re asleep. But you can get around this difficulty by asking a bed partner to observe your sleep habits, or by recording yourself during sleep. If pauses occur while you snore, and if choking or gasping follow the pauses, these are major signs that you have sleep apnea.</P>
<H2>Major Signs & Symptoms</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Loud and chronic snoring almost every night</LI>
  <LI>Choking, snorting, or gasping during sleep</LI>
  <LI>Pauses in breathing</LI>
  <LI>Waking up at night feeling short of breath</LI>
  <LI>Daytime sleepiness and fatigue, no matter how much time you spend in bed</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Other Warning Signs & Symptoms</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Waking up with a dry mouth or sore throat</LI>
  <LI>Insomnia or nighttime awakenings</LI>
  <LI>Going to the toilet frequently during the night</LI>
  <LI>Forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating</LI>
  <LI>Uncharacteristic moodiness, irritability, or depression</LI>
  <LI>Morning headaches</LI>
  <LI>Restless or fitful sleep</LI>
  <LI>Impotence</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Signs & Symptoms in Children</H2>
<P>While obstructive sleep apnea can be common in children, it’s not always easy to recognize. In addition to continuous loud snoring, children with sleep apnea may adopt strange sleeping positions and suffer from bedwetting, excessive perspiration at night, or night terrors.</P>
<P>If you suspect your child may have sleep apnea, consult a pediatrician who specializes in sleep disorders. Once obstructive sleep apnea is diagnosed, surgery to remove the child’s tonsils or adenoids usually corrects the problem.</P>

<H2>Causes & Risk Factors for Obstructive Sleep Apnea</H2>
<P>Anyone can have sleep apnea—young, old, male, female, and even children. However, certain risk factors have been associated with obstructive and central sleep apnea.</P>
<P>You have a higher risk for obstructive sleep apnea if you are (or have):</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Overweight or obese</LI>
  <LI>Men over the age of 50</LI>
  <LI>Women past menopause</LI>
  <LI>Related to someone who has sleep apnea</LI>
  <LI>Black, Hispanic, or a Pacific Islander</LI>
  <LI>A smoker</LI>
  <LI>High blood pressure</LI>
  <LI>A thick neck (neck circumference greater than 15.75 in or 40 cm)</LI>
  <LI>Deviated septum</LI>
  <LI>Receding chin</LI>
  <LI>Enlarged tonsils or adenoids (the most common cause of sleep apnea in children)</LI>
  <LI>A small airway, a set-back lower jaw or a small lower jaw, large tonsils, a large tongue or nasal blockage</LI>
  <LI>Allergies or other medical conditions that cause nasal congestion and blockage</LI>
  <LI>A medical condition that makes some of these factors more likely such as Down’s syndrome</LI>
</UL>
<P>Obstructive sleep apnea can be made worse by drinking alcohol, using sedatives such as sleeping 
pills and smoking.</P>

<H2>Risk Factors for Central Sleep Apnea</H2>
<P>Like obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea is more common in males and people over the age of 65. However, unlike obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea is often associated with serious illness, such as heart disease, stroke, neurological disease, or spinal or brainstem injury.</P>
