<H2>What Are Sleep Disorders?</H2>
<P>Sleep disorders are a group of conditions that affect the 
ability to sleep well on a regular basis. Whether they are caused by a health 
problem or by too much stress, sleep disorders are becoming increasingly common 
in the United States. In fact, more than 75 percent of Americans between ages 20 and 59 
report having sleeping difficulties fairly regularly. </P>
<P>Most people occasionally experience sleeping problems due to
 stress, hectic schedules, and other outside influences. However, when these 
issues begin to occur on a regular basis and interfere with daily life, they may
 indicate a sleeping disorder. </P>
<P>Depending on the type of sleep disorder, people may have a 
difficult time falling asleep and may feel extremely tired throughout the day. 
The lack of sleep can have a negative impact on energy, mood, concentration, and 
overall health. </P>
<P>In some cases, sleep disorders can be a symptom of another
 medical or mental health condition. These sleeping problems may eventually go
 away once treatment is obtained for the underlying cause. When sleep disorders
 aren’t caused by another condition, treatment normally involves a combination
 of medical treatments and lifestyle changes. &nbsp;</P>
<P>It’s important to receive a diagnosis and treatment right away 
if you suspect you might have a sleep disorder. When left untreated, the 
negative effects of sleep disorders can lead to further health consequences. 
They can also affect your performance at work, cause strain in relationships, 
and impair your ability to perform daily activities. </P>

<H2> What Are the Symptoms of Sleep Disorders?</H2>
<P>Symptoms can differ depending on the severity and type of
 sleeping disorder. They may also vary when sleep disorders are a result of
 another condition. However, general symptoms of sleep disorders include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>difficulty falling or staying asleep</LI>
  <LI>daytime fatigue</LI>
  <LI>strong urge to take naps during the day</LI>
  <LI>irritability or anxiety</LI>
  <LI>lack of concentration</LI>
  <LI>depression</LI></UL>
  	
<H2> What Causes Sleep Disorders?</H2>
<P>There are many conditions, diseases, and disorders that can 
cause sleep disturbances. In many cases, sleep disorders develop as a result of 
an underlying health problem.</P>
<H3>Allergies and Respiratory Problems</H3>
<P>Allergies, colds, and upper respiratory infections can make it 
challenging to breathe at night. The inability to breathe through your nose can 
also cause sleeping difficulties. </P>
<H3>Nocturia</H3>
<P>Nocturia, or frequent urination, may disrupt your sleep by 
causing you to wake up during the night. Hormonal imbalances and diseases of the
 urinary tract may contribute to the development of this condition. (Be sure to
 call your doctor right away if frequent urination is accompanied by bleeding or
 pain.)</P>
<H3>Chronic Pain</H3>
<P>Constant pain can make it difficult to fall asleep. It might 
even wake you up after you fall asleep. Some of the most common causes of 
chronic pain include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>arthritis</LI>
  <LI>chronic fatigue syndrome</LI>
  <LI>fibromyalgia</LI>
  <LI>inflammatory bowel disease</LI>
  <LI>persistent headaches</LI>
  <LI>continuous lower back pain</LI></UL>
<P>In some cases, chronic pain may even be exacerbated by sleep 
disorders. For instance, doctors believe the development of fibromyalgia might 
be linked to sleeping problems. </P>
<H3>Stress and Anxiety</H3>
<P>Stress and anxiety often have a negative impact on sleep 
quality. It can be difficult for you to fall asleep or to stay asleep. 
Nightmares, sleep talking, or sleepwalking may also disrupt your 
sleep.</P>
<H2> What Are the Different Types of Sleep Disorders?</H2>
<P>There are numerous different types of sleep disorders. Some may
 be caused by other underlying health conditions. </P>
<H3>Insomnia</H3>
<P>Insomnia refers to the inability to fall asleep or to remain asleep. It can be caused by 
jet lag, stress and anxiety, hormones, or digestive problems. It may also be a 
symptom of another condition. Insomnia can be very problematic for your overall 
health and quality of life, potentially causing:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>depression</LI>
  <LI>difficulty concentrating</LI>
  <LI>irritability </LI>
  <LI>weight gain</LI>
  <LI>impaired work or school performance</LI></UL>
<P>Unfortunately, insomnia is extremely common in the United 
States. Approximately 50 percent of American adults experience it at some point in 
their lives. The disorder is most prevalent among older adults and women. </P>
<P>Insomnia is usually classified as one of three types:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>chronic, which is when insomnia happens on a regular basis for at least 
  one month </LI>
  <LI>intermittent, which is when insomnia occurs periodically </LI>
  <LI>transient, which is when insomnia lasts for just a few nights at a 
  time</LI></UL>
<H3>Sleep Apnea</H3>
<P>Sleep apnea is characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. This is a serious medical 
condition that causes the body to take in less oxygen. It can also cause you to 
wake up during the night.</P>
<H3>Parasomnias</H3>
<P>Parasomnias are a class of sleep disorders that cause abnormal 
movements and behaviors during sleep. They include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>sleepwalking</LI>
  <LI>sleep talking</LI>
  <LI>groaning </LI>
  <LI>nightmares</LI>
  <LI>bedwetting </LI>
  <LI>teeth grinding or jaw clenching</LI></UL>
<H3>Restless Leg Syndrome</H3>
<P>Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is an overwhelming need to move the legs. This urge is
 sometimes accompanied by a tingling sensation in the legs. While these symptoms
 can occur during the day, they are most prevalent at night. RLS is often
 associated with certain health conditions, including ADHD and Parkinson’s
 disease, but the exact cause isn’t always known. </P>
<H3>Narcolepsy</H3>
<P>Narcolepsy is characterized by “sleep attacks” that occur during the day. This means that you 
will suddenly feel extremely tired and fall asleep without warning. The disorder 
can also cause sleep paralysis, which may make you physically unable to move 
right after waking up. Although narcolepsy may occur on its own, it is also 
associated with certain neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<H2> How Are Sleep Disorders Diagnosed?</H2>
<P>Your doctor will first perform a physical exam and gather
 information about your symptoms and medical history. They will also order
 various tests, including: &nbsp;</P>
<UL>
  <LI>polysomnography: a sleep study that evaluates oxygen levels, body movements, and brain waves 
  to determine how they disrupt sleep </LI>
  <LI>electroencephalogram: a test that assesses electrical activity in the brain and detects any potential
   problems associated with this activity</LI>
  <LI>genetic blood testing: a blood test commonly used to diagnose narcolepsy 
  and other underlying health conditions that might be causing sleeping 
  problems</LI></UL>
<P>These tests can be crucial in determining the right course of
 treatment for sleep disorders. </P>
<H2> How Are Sleep Disorders Treated?</H2>
<P>Treatment for sleep disorders can vary depending on the type and 
underlying cause. However, it generally includes a combination of medical 
treatments and lifestyle changes. </P>
<H3>Medical Treatments</H3>
<P>Medical treatment for sleep disturbances might include any of 
the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>sleeping pills</LI>
  <LI>melatonin supplements</LI>
  <LI>allergy or cold medication</LI>
  <LI>medications for any underlying health issues</LI>
  <LI>breathing device or surgery (usually for sleep apnea)</LI>
  <LI>a dental guard (usually for teeth grinding)</LI></UL>

<H3>Lifestyle Changes </H3>
<P>Lifestyle adjustments can greatly improve your quality of sleep,
 especially when they’re done along with medical treatments. You may want to 
consider:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>incorporating more vegetables and fish into your diet, and reducing sugar 
  intake</LI>
  <LI>reducing stress and anxiety by exercising</LI>
  <LI>creating and sticking to a regular sleeping schedule</LI>
  <LI>drinking less water before bedtime &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>limiting your caffeine intake, especially in the late afternoon or 
  evening</LI>
  <LI>decreasing tobacco and alcohol use</LI>
  <LI>eating smaller low carbohydrate meals before bedtime</LI></UL>
<P>Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can also 
significantly improve your sleep quality. While you might be tempted to sleep in 
on the weekends, this can make it more difficult to wake up and fall asleep 
during the workweek. </P>
<H2> What Is the Outlook for Someone with a Sleep Disorder?</H2>
<P>The effects of sleep disorders can be so disruptive that you 
will likely want immediate relief. Unfortunately, long-term cases can take a bit
 more time to resolve. However, if you stick with your treatment plan and
 regularly communicate with your doctor, you can eventually find your way to
 better sleep.</P>
