<H1><font color="#38b4ea">What is sleep apnea?</font></H1>
<font color="#909090">
<P>Sleep apnea affects the way you breathe when you’re sleeping. In untreated sleep apnea, breathing is briefly interrupted or becomes very shallow during sleep. These breathing pauses typically last between 10 to 20 seconds and can occur up to hundreds of times a night, jolting you out of your natural sleep rhythm. As a consequence, you spend more time in light sleep and less time in the deep, restorative sleep you need to be energetic, mentally sharp, and productive the next day.</P>
<P>The chronic sleep deprivation that comes with sleep apnea results in daytime sleepiness, slow reflexes, poor concentration, and an increased risk of accidents. Sleep apnea can also lead to serious health problems over time, including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and weight gain. But with treatment you can control the symptoms, get your sleep back on track, and start enjoying being refreshed and alert every day.</P>

<H2>Types of sleep apnea</H2>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Obstructive sleep apnea</STRONG> is the most common type of sleep apnea. It occurs when the soft tissue in the back of your throat relaxes during sleep and blocks the airway, often causing you to snore loudly.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Central sleep apnea</STRONG> is a much less common type of sleep apnea that involves the central nervous system, occurring when the brain fails to signal the muscles that control breathing. People with central sleep apnea seldom snore.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Complex sleep apnea</STRONG> is a combination of obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Obstructive sleep apnea</H2>
<P>Obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, is the most common type of sleep apnea. OSA is a breathing problem that 
happens when you sleep. It can affect anyone – men, women or children.</P>
<P>When you’re asleep, your throat muscles relax. In some people, a narrower 
airway means they snore. But if your throat closes completely, you stop 
breathing for a time. For some people this happens throughout the night and it’s 
called OSA.</P>
<P>OSA disrupts your sleep, making you sleepy during the day. So if it’s not 
treated, it can have a big impact on your life – you might feel exhausted when 
you’re awake, and you might doze off at any time – so it’s not safe to drive for 
example. And if you don’t get help, it can have a big impact on your health 
too.</P>
<P>We know that lots of people go undiagnosed.&nbsp;The good news is that there 
is effective treatment.</P>
<H2>What does OSA mean?</H2>
<P>It’s called OSA because:</P>
<P><STRONG>Obstructive:</STRONG> there’s an <STRONG>obstruction</STRONG> in the 
airway of your throat<BR><STRONG>Sleep:</STRONG>&nbsp;it happens when you’re 
<STRONG>asleep</STRONG><BR><STRONG>Apnea:</STRONG>&nbsp;this means you 
<STRONG>stop breathing</STRONG></P>
<H2>What happens when you have OSA?</H2>
<P>When you go to sleep your muscles relax, including those in your throat. In 
some people the relaxing muscles cause the airways to narrow, which can reduce 
the amount of air flowing in and out of your airways. This makes you snore.</P>
<P>If your throat closes completely, you stop breathing for a time.&nbsp;This is 
called an <STRONG>apnea</STRONG> if it last for 10 seconds or more. If the 
airways in your throat narrow this is called a <STRONG>hypopnea</STRONG>. When 
this happens, there may be a dip in the level of oxygen in your blood.</P>
<P>Your brain will start your breathing again. Some people wake up briefly, but 
others are not aware of what’s happening. Breathing often restarts with a gasp 
or grunt and some movement. You relax again, and the pattern then starts 
again.</P>
<P>If you have severe OSA, this cycle can happen hundreds of times a night. 
These frequent arousals disrupt your sleep and so you can feel very sleepy 
during the day.</P>
