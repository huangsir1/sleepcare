<H2>I think I might have OSA</H2>
<P>If you think you, or someone you know, might have OSA, do the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale test</A>. This helps to assess how likely you are to fall 
asleep in everyday situations.</P>
<P>Take this along to your GP to talk about your symptoms and concerns. Your GP 
will ask about your symptoms, your health and your medical history, and about 
how sleepy you are when awake.</P>
<P>Your GP might give you lifestyle advice about the best ways to get a good 
night’s sleep, lose weight and stop smoking.</P>
<P>If it is suspected that you might have OSA, you will usually be referred to a 
<STRONG>sleep clinic</STRONG>.</P>
<P>If your GP is not concerned, but you still are, keep trying to get a definite 
diagnosis. </P>
<H2>What happens at a sleep clinic?</H2>
<P>Sleep clinics are specialist clinics that assess, diagnose and treat people 
with a range of sleep problems, including OSA.</P>
<P>Once you’ve been referred, you’ll be assessed. Clinics assess people in 
different ways. Some arrange for you to have an overnight sleep study at home 
before you visit, while others see you first before deciding if you need an 
overnight study.</P>
<H3>Assessment and diagnosis</H3>
<P>Clinics have at least one consultant and other staff, such as nurses and 
technicians. They will assess if you have OSA by asking questions and examining 
you. They will also ask you to complete a form about how sleepy you are – 
usually the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. They may also arrange a sleep study.</P>
<H3>Questions about your medical history</H3>
<P>This involves talking about your symptoms and quality of life. If you have a 
partner bring them with you, so they can report on what happens when you’re 
asleep. A good clinical history helps the doctor to reach a diagnosis. It may 
include questions about:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>how long you sleep and the quality of your sleep</LI>
  <LI>shift working (pattern and timing)</LI>
  <LI>your symptoms and how long you have had them</LI>
  <LI>your smoking history</LI>
  <LI>family history of sleep disorders, such as OSA or narcolepsy</LI>
  <LI>your mental health</LI>
  <LI>any medication you use or have used</LI>
  <LI>how sleepy you are and when you might fall asleep</LI>
  <LI>the effect on your work and ability to concentrate</LI></UL>
<H2>Examining you</H2>
<P>This can include measuring:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>your weight and height to find your body mass index (BMI)</LI>
  <LI>your blood pressure</LI>
  <LI>your neck circumference</LI>
  <LI>your jaw size and position</LI></UL>
<P>and assessing:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>your face and jaw appearance and symmetry</LI>
  <LI>the airflow in your nose</LI>
  <LI>your upper airway to see if it’s obstructed</LI>
  <LI>your teeth and having a look at the size of your tongue</LI>
  <LI>the inside of your mouth and upper airway</LI></UL>
<P>The clinic may also do a blood test.</P>
<H2>Having a sleep study</H2>
<P>You’ll usually do&nbsp;a sleep study at home, using equipment lent to you for 
a night. But you may go to hospital overnight for a detailed study.</P>
<P>If you’re worried about the study, ask the sleep clinic what will happen. You 
can do some simple things to prepare, such as avoiding alcohol or caffeine and 
not taking a nap or strenuous exercise on the day. Let the clinic know if you’ve 
got any special requirements. If you’re ill on the date of your study, it’s best 
to postpone it until you’re feeling better.</P>
<P>For the study, you’ll be monitored as you sleep by equipment attached to you. 
This is completely painless and you'll be able to roll over and change 
positions. You may be asked to sleep on your back for a while to see if this 
affects your breathing. If you’re in hospital and experiencing obvious signs of 
OSA, you may be woken up to use a CPAP machine, so you can be assessed with and 
without it.</P>
<P>There are different kinds of sleep studies used to diagnose OSA.</P>
<H3>Oximetry</H3>
<P>This measures the oxygen level in your blood. It’s often the first test for 
OSA, and is usually done in your home. You wear an instrument with a sensor 
called a pulse oximeter. This measures your blood oxygen level and your pulse. 
You’ll have a clip on your finger or earlobe and a device on your wrist.</P>
<H3>Limited sleep study</H3>
<P>This overnight test can be done in hospital or at home. It measures your air 
flow, how your chest moves as you breathe, your heart rate and the oxygen level 
in your blood. Some devices register snoring sounds, body position and leg 
movements. Equipment will be attached to you with tape, wires and straps as you 
sleep.</P>
<H3>Polysomnography or PSG</H3>
<P>This is an overnight study, done in a quiet hospital room. It’s used when the 
results of other tests aren’t clear and in more complex cases. It assesses sleep 
and wakefulness by measuring your brain waves, eye movements and muscle 
movements. It also assesses your heart and lung function, by measuring your air 
flow, the movement of your chest, your oxygen levels and the activity of your 
heart activity. It films you while you sleep.</P>
<H2>Reaching a diagnosis</H2>
<P>Your doctor will diagnose you with OSA if the results of your assessment are 
clear.</P>
<P>If they aren’t, you may be asked to do more tests or to try a treatment 
called CPAP. If CPAP helps, OSA is the most likely cause of your symptoms.</P>
<P>Your doctor will want to see how severe your OSA is to find the best 
treatment for you. You may be told your OSA is mild, moderate or severe, 
depending on how many times you stop breathing in the night and your symptoms 
during the day. Once you’ve been diagnosed with OSA, it can be a relief. You now 
know why you’ve been so sleepy.</P>	
<H2>Treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)</H2>
<P>OSA is a long-term condition and you may need lifelong 
treatment to control the symptoms.</P>
<P>Treatment focuses on reducing the number of breathing pauses you have when 
you’re asleep. You should feel less sleepy during the day, have a better quality 
of life and reduce your risk of getting health complications and having 
accidents.</P>
<H2>Benefits of treatment</H2>
<P>People react differently to treatment, but you’re likely to benefit a lot. 
For example:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>you’ll have more energy and be less sleepy so you feel better physically 
  and mentally</LI>
  <LI>you’ll be safe to drive, if you can satisfy DVLA your symptoms are under 
  control</LI>
  <LI>you’ll start to enjoy things you were finding difficult, such as staying 
  awake to watch a film</LI></UL>
<P>Your partner will also benefit from your treatment. They’ll sleep better too 
as you will not be snoring and you will move less in bed. You’ll be more alert 
during the day, so you can enjoy more quality time together.</P>
<P>Treatments for OSA include&nbsp;<STRONG>lifestyle changes</STRONG>&nbsp;and 
<STRONG>treatments</STRONG> from the&nbsp;sleep clinic.</P>
