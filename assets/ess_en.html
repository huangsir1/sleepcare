your answers to your doctor.</P>
<H2>Epworth Sleepiness Scale</H2>
<P>How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations, in 
comparison to feeling just tired?</P>
<P>Even if you haven't done some of these things recently, try to work out how 
they would have affected you.</P>
<P>Use the following scale to choose the most appropriate number for each 
situation:</P>
<P>0 = would never doze<BR>1 = slight chance of dozing<BR>2 = moderate chance of 
dozing<BR>3 = high chance of dozing</P>
<P>It's important that you answer each question as best you can.</P>
